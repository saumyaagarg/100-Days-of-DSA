Day 25: Advanced Graphs
1. Implement Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph.
2. Solve the "network delay time" problem using Dijkstra's algorithm.
3. Implement Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph.
4. Solve the "minimum cost to connect all points" problem using Primâ€™s algorithm.
5. Solve the "alien dictionary" problem using topological sorting.
