Day 33: Segment Trees Basics
1. Implement a segment tree to find the sum of a range in an array.
2. Modify the segment tree to support point updates and range queries.
3. Solve the "range minimum query (RMQ)" problem using a segment tree.
4. Implement a segment tree to count the number of elements in a range greater than a given value.
5. Solve the "range XOR query" problem using a segment tree.
