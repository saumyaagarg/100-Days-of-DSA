Day 23: Graph Basics
1. Represent a graph using an adjacency list and an adjacency matrix.
2. Implement depth-first search (DFS) for a graph.
3. Implement breadth-first search (BFS) for a graph.
4. Solve the "number of islands" problem using BFS/DFS.
5. Solve the "detect a cycle in an undirected graph" problem using DFS.
